# Configuring SLAs in Hiver

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define target response and resolution times.

## Setup Steps

1. Go to `Settings > SLAs`.
2. Create a new SLA policy; provide a name.
3. Define business hours and holidays.
4. Set targets for `first response` and `resolution` by priority.
5. Use conditions (mailbox, tags, customer tier) to scope the SLA.
6. Save and enable.

## Tips

- Align priorities and targets with customer tiers.
- Use escalation rules to notify when an SLA is at risk.
- Review performance reports to refine thresholds.
